# Mental-Health-Prediction-through-Data-Normalization-and-Modeling-

## Introduction:
This repository contains the implementation of an analysis and modeling project aimed at predicting mental health issues among employees in the tech industry. The project focuses on identifying various factors such as gender, geographical location, and history of mental health illness that contribute to mental health issues, utilizing data visualization methods and statistical models.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to predict the frequency and likelihood of mental illness among employees in the tech industry. By analyzing critical attributes such as family history, wellness program participation, anonymity, and gender, the project aims to provide insights that can help in early intervention and treatment for better performance and well-being in the workplace.

## Data Description:
The dataset used in this project was obtained from a 2014 survey measuring attitudes towards mental health and the frequency of mental health issues in the tech workplace. It contains 27 columns with key attributes essential for analysis, including family history, wellness program participation, anonymity, and gender.
Below describes the tables and relationship between them
